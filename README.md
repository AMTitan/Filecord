Sharex is a website where you can upload large files with for free using discord. I coded the backend in rust mainly because I wanted like rust and I also like that it has networking in the std and I dont need find a library online to use one.

## Run
To run the program you can compile it yourself with rust by doing `cargo build --release` then take the file in `./target/release/server(.exe)` or you can go to the [releases tab](https://github.com/AMTitan/Sharex/releases/latest) and download the latest version. Now you can take the executable and run it on any server you want, and because it does not use a centralized database you can run it on any serverless platform you want!
